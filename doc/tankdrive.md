## Calculations used

### Bottom arm preset

This preset corresponds to when the pendulum is completely level. Measurements indicate that the arm needs to be 18" off the ground in order to successfully drop blocks. We measured the angle of the arm in this position to be 100 degrees. The arm's lowest position is 30 degrees, and the gear ratio is 1:27. TODO encoder calculations

### Top arm preset

This preset corresponds to when the pendulum is completely up as far as it can go. Measurements indicate that the arm needs to be 25" off the ground in order to successfully drop blocks. We measured the angle of the arm in this position to be 130 degrees. The arm's lowest position is 30 degrees, and the gear ratio is 1:27. TODO encoder calculations
